This really simple static website is designed to give teachers who are using the amazing online IDE https://www.repl.it a dashboard where they can easily see all of their students code quickly.

## Instructions for use

The tool requires URLs and student names to be entered manually (for now).

Personally, at the beginning of any project I collect the IDE urls from the students directly by having them copy and paste them into a google form, along with their names. I then simply copy and paste the URLs and names from google forms to initialize the dashboard.

All student screens will automatically load in a grid, one or two screens per row depending on the size of the site.
